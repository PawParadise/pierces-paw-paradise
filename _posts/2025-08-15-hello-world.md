title: "Sprocket's Favorite Chew Toy"
description: "How much does Sprocket like to chew and pull?  All of it, all the likes.  The only problem, other than keeping your balance, is getting a toy that will hold up to the punishment.  Enter the Bionic Toss-N-Tug.  Rachel and I were very impressed with the entire line of Bionic toys when we were at he Global Pet Expo earlier this year.  As part of the display, they dropped the Bionic Ball into a blender, and it survived with minimal damage!  Made from food-grade rubber, these toys are safe AND durable.  If you have a chewer, like we do, give this line of toys a shot."
